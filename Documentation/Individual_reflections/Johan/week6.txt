Sprint 5 number progress was good and the project is in a good state. The prior sprint completed MVP.a and now we are working towards MVP.b, which introduces some new (mostly backend) features. Last sprint I mainly worked with getting the permissions right when the user donâ€™t have granted the app camera access. This was tricky to solve properly and required some very Android specific techniques which was time consuming but interesting to learn. I also shared this new knowledge with the team to ensure that everyone sort of understood how permission requests are done in Android. The other main task this sprint has been database related and the whole team has in a way or another contributed in the progress and testing of the database. The teamwork has thus worked really well and the agile practices really shows its benefits. The coming sprints i wish that we as a team continue in this way and use the agile work methods to our favor.
