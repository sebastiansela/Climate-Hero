This third week of the course we have finalized our user stories according to the INVEST criteria and started our first sprint. The user stories and task chosen for this sprint has mainly been associated with organizational stuff such as finalizing our DoD, setting up our development environment and export of our mockup design from Figma to Android Studio. Most of the work has gone smooth, but the mockup export was harder than expected. The team thought that we would be able to export the whole design mockup from Figma to Android Studio since Figma had support for this. This did however not work as intended for us since the free version of the export plugin had some restrictions. After a few hours of researching and testing we decided to group components together and export them as SVG’s. These SVG’s we embedded into ImageView’s in Android Studio and thus we were able to recreate the mockup as an Android user interface. This work is not complete as of the time i’m writing this but it should be completed by the sprints deadline. 

The other main struggle this week has been to find time where all of the team can gather and work simultaneously. Since most of the initial development user stories are blocked by each other it has been rather hard to divide up the work. During the coming sprints the user stories is more independent and thus is this “problem” most likely a one-off event. The team work has despite this been good, and during the meetings we’ve had all members have been engaged and contributed with good ideas on how we should move forward.

We have also taken the decision to run our sprints Monday - Monday since we have our Tuesday morning meetings. On this meeting the team intends to reflect on the passed sprint and plan for the coming one. During the sprint de-brief and sprint planning we aim the utilize the SMART set of criteria to set of clear goals of what we wish to achieve with the sprints.
