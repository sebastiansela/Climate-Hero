Last sprint we complete the big user stories that brought the most user value into the app. For this sprint we had to come up with some more features to continue to improve the app so we decided to add climate facts to the loading screen. My main tasks have been associated with doing the front end of this feature, and i feel like i’ve become more comfortable with dealing with Android XML files. I have tried to spread this knowledge to the rest of the team members to make sure that everyone is sort of on the same knowledge-level. For the coming sprint i hope that we can do some code reviews to really make sure that everyone is á jour with our codebase.
