During this sprint the workload have been extremely high in my parallel running course, which have resulted in less hours put into the climate hero project. Our social contract states that it is expected that one puts in 20 hours of work every week, and this have not been achieved during this sprint. I take this as a sign that I need to plan my time better and maybe put into my calendar when to work on which course to make sure that both courses get similar attention. The main user story progress during this sprint was put in on a single day, and all the user stories and task assigned on me got completed. The main one was to incorporate KPIs to better track our performance. One particularly interesting KPI was Time Spent vs Estimated Time, which at least for my stories, showed that I consequently over estimate how much time a task will take. Forward I will monitor this KPI and make sure that my Time Spent vs Estimated Time move towards each other to improve my time estimation abilities. This will likely also help us as a team to select a more suitable amount of user stories and tasks for the coming sprints. This sprint is the first where KPIs has been incorporated so some indicators might be misleading until more data from the coming sprints is received. Another completed user story is one fragment that displays a, so far, hardcoded suggestion on a recycling bin. This task required me to read in the google developer documentation to learn about the Android viewmodel pattern and i think we will utilize this model more throughout the project. I will also try to encourage myself to look more into the documentation before googling.
