week 5

This week was set up so we could reach our MVP (minimal value product). We had some issues in the beggining and going through the later part of the sprint
regarding the Cloud Vision API, with the code and some tests that wouldn't work. Me and my partners mostly worked together on this matter, searching for information on what the 
problem of the API could be, and I found some links saying that it maybe was because of Android Studio and gradle having som files that are written in kotlin, but that turned out false. The
problem was solved by introducing a thread to the program. Besides the teamwork of debugging, I also worked with the database and added new values and drew in our UML to envision our application. As mentioned 
last week, one of my tickets/tasks this week was to implement a camera function which i did last sprint, as a false start (don't know the proper translation of a 'tjuvstart' in english). Working with Scrum/Jira
has become convinient for me, and I really like working with it.
