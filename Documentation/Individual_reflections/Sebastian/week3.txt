Week 3
This week we started using our scrum and get the basics of setting up android studios 
to work. What I want to learn to understand better is to work with .xml and android studios
when creating our app. To help myself and the team I can search for information on 
the internet like videos and such. I found a good starter video wich I Shared with
my teamates about getting started with AS, wich was my "work" in this weeks sprint,
although we worked all together with the initial tasks for the project most of the 
time this sprint.
