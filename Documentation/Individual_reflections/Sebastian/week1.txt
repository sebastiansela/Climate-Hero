Individual Reflection week 1

Since it is the first week this reflection will be quite short.
But my goal in this course is to learn how to work with scrum and learn how agile development works. I want to be a good team member that can help and ensure that everyone gets their voices heard when working with our product.
This week, my contribution with the use of scrum is little since we havenâ€™t yet started. But we have made a social contract which everyone did together and discussed.
