As I'm not responsible for any specific task I will try to help teams to investigate and get information on how to solve this weeks issues. Especially I will look into the Cloud Vision API. I will also continue drive the team forward as Scrum Master and as quickly as possible try to identify obstacles and aid in solving them.
