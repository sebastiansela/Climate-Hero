This past week the team focused the sprint on one user story that is the base for all other. Therefore we collaborated on all parts to learn as much as possible from each other. For next week I will try to study videos about how to use Android Studio smarter and more efficient. As Scrum Master I will prepare the agenda for our weekly Tuesday meeting to have the best possible conditions on finish next sprint and divide tasks to increase individual progress.
